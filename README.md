# FreeRTOS-Breakdown
Here you can find the main project report of this Free RTOS research work which clearly explains the concept and implementation of ready queues
with proper visualizing examples and have explained the codes related to them clearly from scratch.
The subdocuments related to this project includes all notes of our members which they noted while exploring this code using which we have been 
able to build this final project report.<br/><br/>
<h1>Hybrid Data Structure - Indexed AVL Tree</h1>
Here you can find the materials related to implementation of Indexed AVL Tree. To access all materials related to this you can visit the branch named Index AVL Tree 
where you can find the project report and ppt which explains the whole concept of Indexed AVL Tree along with it's performance and experimental Analysis.
You can also find Indexed AVL Tree simulator where all operations can be performed. There are other documents like output pdf are provided which will help in understanding the working of the code
