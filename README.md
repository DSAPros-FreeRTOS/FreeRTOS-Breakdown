# INDEXED AVL TREE IMPLEMENTATION
Here you can find all files related to the implementation of Indexed AVL Tree using both Python and C++ programming Language
Let me explain you the contents in each file <br/>
<h3>IndexAvl.py</h3> It is a python file which contains the python code of Indexed AVL Tree
It is menu driven program which provides various operations like Insertion , Deletion , Searching , all types of Traversals and also will be able to
calculate the time taken by each operation <br/>
Another functionality includes the ability to insert data through .xlsx files, which can be accomplished using the Pandas package.
<h3>IndexAvl.cpp</h3> It is a C++ file containing the implementation of Indexed AVL Tree <br/>
<h3>Simulator.py</h3> It is a python file which contains the python code for Indexed AVL Tree Simulator done using Tkinter Package <br/>
<h3>IndexedAVLTree_SIMULATION.exe</h3> This is extension of Indexed AVL Tree Simulation. Anyone using Windows can just download this and run it as administrator<br/>
<b>Steps to Follow</b><br/>

<h3>DATA.xlsx and DUPLICATE_DATA.xlsx</h3>
Here we have an excel sheet whose column name is 'A' and has a data set of 50 elements. In Data.xlsx we have Data set of Unique elements ranging from 1-100
and In Duplicate_Data.xlsx we have Data set of elements having Duplicates as well<br/>
<h3>Unique Data.pdf and Duplicate Data.pdf</h3>
This pdf provides the sample outputs you get while using Unique Data and Duplicate Data<br/>
